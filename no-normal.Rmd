What would the world be like without the normal curve?
========================================================

Once upon a time there was a land called Praxis. Mr and Mrs Boxy lived there happily in 01 Uniform, Distribution. 

They were content in this land. They made many babies. Here is a family portrait.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

x <- runif(1000)
qplot(x) + ggtitle("Uniform Babies")
```

They often took their children to hike the uneven peaks of Gammamountain.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(rgamma(1000, 3, 4)) + ggtitle("Gammamountain")
```
