========================================================

Once upon a time there was a land called Praxis. Mr and Mrs Boxy lived there happily in 01 Uniform, Distribution. 

They were content in this land. They made many babies. Here is a family portrait.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

x <- runif(1000)
qplot(x) + ggtitle("Uniform Babies")
```
